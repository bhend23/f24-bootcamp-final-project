# Music Discovery App

## Purpose
My Music Discovery project is designed to help users find their favorite songs, create playlists, and explore new tracks.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Language**: Swift  
- **Framework**: SwiftUI  
- **APIs**: Spotify API  
- **Platform**: iOS  

## Features
- **Search for Songs**: Users can search for tracks by entering song titles, artists, or keywords.  
- **Song Recommendations**: Users will  be recommended songs based on the songs in their playlist

## Obstacles and Future Additions
- **Obstacle**: The Spotify API integration had challenges with fetching access tokens and handling network responses, which were resolved with async/await.
- **Future Additions**:
  - **Audio Playing**: I may try and add audio support in the future to make the songs play.
